1. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. 
     If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.
	Sample String : 'webcom'
	Expected Result : 'weom'
	Sample String : 'wo'
	Expected Result : 'wowo'
	Sample String : ' w'
	Expected Result : Empty String 

2. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string - 
     -where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself. 
	Sample String : 'restart'
	Expected Result : 'resta$t'

3. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and returns the length of the longest one.

4. Write a Python program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input - 
     - and prints the unique words in sorted form (alphanumerically).
	Sample Words : red, white, black, red, green, black
	Expected Result : black, green, red, white
5. Write a Python program to shuffle and print a given list.

6. Write a Python program to select an item randomly from a list.

7. Write a Python program to find the second largest number in a list.

8. Write a Python program to convert a list of multiple integers into a single integer. 
	Sample list: [11, 33, 50]
	Expected Output: 113350

9.  Write a Python program to find the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. 
	Sample lists: [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [10,11,12], [7,8,9]
	Expected Output: [10, 11, 12]

10. Write a Python program to count repeated characters in a string.
	Sample string: 'thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog'
 	Expected output :
	o 4
	e 3
	u 2
	h 2
	r 2
	t 2
